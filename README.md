# stockChartAPI
Project --> 8

This is my eight project where im testing my beginner javascript knowledge with a little bit of css and of course html5

The project reason was learning APIs (in this one mainly fetch) and using them.
The project theme is an classic chart where you can search for different stock prices, using different options for viewing the chart.
